Divvy Bikes Visualization
===========

Repo for divvy bikes visualization that shows bikes moving around the city of Chicago.  

It is inspired and based on the work of [NYC Taxis: A Day in the Life](http://nyctaxi.herokuapp.com), a data visualization that shows the movements and earnings of a single NYC taxi over 24 hours.
